# Getting started

I recommend that you read "[What is Tent?](./what-is-it.md)" before continuing. It will give you a good overview of what Tent is and what it is not. Just to make sure you are in the right place :)

## Installation

```bash
npm i @tentjs/tent
```

### Typescript

Tent is written in TypeScript. It is not required to use TypeScript, but it is highly **recommended**. The rest of the documentation will be written as if you are using TypeScript.
