# Getting started

I recommend that you read "[What is Tent?](./what-is-it.md)" before continuing. It will give you a good overview of what Tent is and what it is not. Just to make sure you are in the right place :)

### OK, let's get started!

When you are ready, you can start by installing Tent to your existing project.

```bash
npm i @tentjs/tent
```

Or, you can use the official starter template.

```bash
git clone @tentjs/starter my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run watch
```

That's it! You are ready to start building. Next up you should read about [Components](./components.md), and follow the documentation linearly from there.

### Typescript

Tent is written in TypeScript. It is not required to use TypeScript, but it is highly **recommended**. The rest of the documentation will be written as if you are using TypeScript - because you should be.
