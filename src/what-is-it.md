# What is Tent?

Tent is a lightweight, jsx-free, no-nonsense library for building interactive web interfaces. It is built on top of the standard web APIs, so you don't need to learn a new framework to use it.

It is built with the [Islands Architecture](https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/islands-architecture) in mind, meaning that most of the web page is server-rendered, and the job of Tent is to add chunks of interactivity where it is needed.

# What is Tent not?

Tent is _not_ a framework. You won't find a router, server-side rendering, or a state management system. Tent is built to be used with the standard web APIs, so you can use it with any other library or framework.
